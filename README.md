```poem
In lines of code, both old and new,
We craft the world with just a few.
From loops that spin and functions that call,
We build the dreams that make us bold.

A keyboard's whisper, a screen's bright light,
We solve the puzzles, day and night.
With logic as sharp as a coder's mind,
We turn the abstract into signed.

The bugs we chase, the fixes we find,
Each error a step on the path designed.
For in the code, both simple and grand,
We find our purpose, our shared hand.

So here's to the craft, the art, the science,
The magic that makes the digital dance.
In every line, a story to tell,
We code the future, we code ourselves.
